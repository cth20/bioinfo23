### What is gene?   
Gene is a sequence of information in the nucleotide. 

### Why genes are so few in humankind?  
The size of genome is not related to the evolution of creatures. It doesn't mean that superior creatures own more base-pair than the lower ones.   
Humankind owns about 3Gbp. However, 90 percent of them are not coding genes. The extra base-pairs are not useless. Several functions have been revealed in the resent a few decades. 

### What are the defferences between algorithm and model?    
算法不是我可以掌握的东西，模型不是我可理解的，但一定程度上我可以使用它。

### What problems is bioinformatics trying to solve?
